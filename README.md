Super easy to use:

install BepInEx following the docs https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html
then place the mod in the Dustland Delivery/BepInEX/plugins/ folder

Now the trading sliders for caravans and cities will usually jump somewhere in the middle where the profit against base value is the highest.
